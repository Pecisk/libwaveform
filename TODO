Stuff I have to do

# Gstreamer 'level' element
* Need to provide posibility to split buffer and therefore have less interval than buffer limits
* Need to provide posibility to get low peak of interval

# WaveformData
* Go trough transfer anotations for WaveformData
* Problems with NULL result passing to waveform_data_add, please check this

# WaveformDrawing
* Zoom level logic - how to handle it
Mostly question how to identify different zoom levels - one idea is to have enum struct with
identifiers of zoom levels and then bind them to multipliers. Rate will be samples per second.
* Rewrite of Waveform drawing logic and implementing subclasses of different waveforms
* Style support

# WaveformReader
* Async get_levels version
