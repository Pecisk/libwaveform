Stuff I have to do

# Gstreamer 'level' element
* Need to provide posibility to split buffer and therefore have less interval than buffer limits
* Need to provide posibility to get low peak of interval

# WaveformData
* Go trough transfer anotations for WaveformData
* Problems with NULL result passing to waveform_data_add, please check this

# WaveformDrawing
* Zoom level logic
Currently I'm going with 'pixels per second' concept as seen in Pitivi as it seems most logical.
I also try to detect which interval is best to use to draw waveform. It has some flaws, but it's a start.
* Rewrite of Waveform drawing logic and implementing subclasses of different waveforms
* Style support

# WaveformReader
* Async get_levels version
