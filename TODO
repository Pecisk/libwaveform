Stuff I have to do

# Needed fixes in Gstreamer 'level' element
* Need to provide posibility to split buffer and therefore have less interval than buffer limits
* Need to provide posibility to get low peak of interval

# Initial Widget code
* Create waveform using rms values first

# Go trough transfer anotations for WaveformData
# Problems with NULL result passing to waveform_data_add, please check this
